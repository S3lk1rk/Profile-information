**`Professional developer (Software engineer/Web developer)`**

Web developer and passionate basketball player, devoted to learning and problem-solving. My projects are a mixture of university projects and personal development. I primarily work on a web application on behalf of the Tiresias project at Imperial College London, however, due to the nature of the work it is not public.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Matthew's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  As a high school student, I started coding as part of my classes and found that I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect. After dipping into the basics of object-orientated programming and web development I decided to pursue it at university. I graduated in 2024 with 1st Class Honours from Glasgow Caledonian University and have continued to work for Imperial College London on web development work started during my penultimate year.
